## Introduction

**RayGlow** is a Natural Language Processing library for C# that aims to use new cutting-edge techniques as well as experimental algorithms and architectures that come directly from my imagination.
This repository was specially made to develop my skills as well as let my mind out of the box insomuch that I would be able to invent algorithms that could result in great perspectives for the future of NLP.

My main goal is to implement a new **Word Representation** system using **Quantum Computing** based algorithms and methods such as Matrix Product States with **Tensor Networks** (see my other work **Syngular** which is a Python Tensor Networks library for Deep Learning).
With further advances, I will focus on more complex structure such as Recurrent Tensor Networks and Tensormers (Transformers using Tensor Networks that I aim to create!)
